## Testing

- [A. Via Python](#a-via-python)
- [B. Via Docker](#b-via-docker)

### A. Via Python

> [!NOTE]
> This solution uses a different theme than https://designsafe-ci.org/user-guide/.

0. Have Python installed.\
    <sup>Known supported versions are [from 3.10 to 3.12](https://github.com/DesignSafe-CI/DS-User-Guide/blob/6c22d2f/pyproject.toml).</sup>
1. Navigate into your clone of this repo.
2. Install dependencies:\
    <sup>You should only need to do this once, or after a new release.</sup>
    ```shell
    ./bin/tacc-setup.sh
    pip install poetry

    ```
3. Isolate dependencies:
    ```shell
    poetry shell

    ```
4. Update & Serve the docs:
    ```shell
    poetry install
    cd user-guide
    mkdocs serve

    ```
    <sup>After the `poetry shell` command, you should be in a Poetry-managed environment. Your prompt might be prefixed with the name of the environment.</sup>
5. Open the website _at the URL echoed by the program_ e.g.
    [http://127.0.0.1:8000/user-guide/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/user-guide/).

### B. Via Docker

0. Have Docker installed.\
    <sup>We recommend doing so via [Docker-Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).</sup>
1. Navigate into your clone of this repository.
2. Start the Docker container to serve the docs. 

   Linux or Mac (macOS) user:
   ```shell
    make build
    make start

    ```
   Windows user:
   ```shell
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up

    ```
4. Open the website at the URL provided e.g.
    [http://0.0.0.1:8000/user-guide/](http://0.0.0.1:8000/user-guide/).


[^2]: To manually build or deploy, consult [our internal documentation](https://tacc-main.atlassian.net/wiki/x/aBhv).

## Automatic Builds

Automatic builds (not deploys) should occur on pushes to any branch.[^2]

## Automatic Deployment

Automatic deploys should occur after an automatic build on the `main` branch.[^2]

## Releases

All commits to `main` will trigger a docker build and push a new image to `designsafeci/ds-user-guide:latest`.

A Watchtower service monitors new pushes to this dockerhub repo and pull down new images on the fly to [https://designsafeci-dev.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guide/](https://designsafeci-dev.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guide/).
