## Compress &amp; Extract

Most web browsers do not support upload/download of Folders, only Files. For moving Folders in and out of the Data Depot, we provide Compress and Extract tools that enable you to transform your Folder into a File (Compress) or to convert that File back into a Folder (Extract).
