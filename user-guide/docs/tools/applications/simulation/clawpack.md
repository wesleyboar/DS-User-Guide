# clawpack User Guide


<a href="http://www.clawpack.org/" target="_blank">Clawpack</a> (“Conservation Laws Package”) is a collection of finite volume methods for linear and nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. Clawpack employs high-resolution Godunov-type methods with limiters in a general framework applicable to many kinds of waves.

## How to Start a Clawpack Interactive Session in the Workspace

The Clawpack 5.4.0 suite has been installed into the DesignSafe Jupyter Hub environment. It is available for use with Python2 both from the command-line and in Jupyter notebooks. If using python2 from the terminal, you'll want to use the binaries located in '/opt/conda/envs/python2/bin'. To start using Clawpack:

<ul>
	<li>Select the Clawpack application from the Simulation tab in the Workspace.</li>
	<li>Click on Launch Jupyter. </li>
	<li>Open a GeoClaw notebook (see below to access an example notebook to get you started).</li>
</ul>

## Example Clawpack Use Case

An example GeoClaw notebook in Jupyter can be seen by navigating to 'community / Jupyter Notebooks / Workspace Application Sample Notebooks / GeoClaw' and opening 'GeoClaw_topotools_example.ipynb', and can be previewed and copied to your own space from <a href="https://www.designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/public/designsafe.storage.community//Jupyter%20Notebooks/Workspace%20Application%20Sample%20Notebooks/GeoClaw" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
