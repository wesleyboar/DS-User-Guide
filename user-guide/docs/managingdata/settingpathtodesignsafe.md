The data stored on DesignSafe resides on the large (40 PB), shared data resource Corral located at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. Importantly, Corral services many different projects, not only DesignSafe, and as such utilizes a complex file structure for organization. The purpose of this documentation is to explain how to navitage this complex file structure to locate the directories pertinent to your data transfer needs on DesignSafe.

There are four main locations for data transfers on DesignSafe: <a href="#mydata">My Data</a>, <a href="#myprojects">My Projects</a>, <a href="#published-nheri">Published</a>, and <a href="#published-nees">Published (NEES)</a>, they are each presented in detail below.
